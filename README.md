### Editing Follow Buttons

Crisp uses Font Awesome for icons. See the Font Awesome documentation for the [full list of icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and [usage tips](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/).

I have placed some common buttons in **follow.hbs**, with more options in the commented out sections. Make sure to replace the `username` in the URLs so the links point to your profiles.

### Features, Changelog, and Technical Notes
